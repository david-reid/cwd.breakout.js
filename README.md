#Intro

In the last session we added a start screen. In this session
we'll display a game over screen when all the bricks are
gone.

Links are in the description.

## Main

First we'll add our new screen to index.html.

Then we'll update our stylesheet to include the new screen.

We'll update our startGame function with logic that closes
our new screen when the game starts.

Then we'll create a new gameOver function that displays our
new screen. It will also hide all other screens.

We'll update our bricks class with a new function that checks
if there are no bricks left.

In our main move function, we'll check to see if the brick count
is zero, if it is, then we'll show the gameOver screen.

And there you have it. When the bricks are gone, the game ends.

## Outro

And that is it. All links are in the description.

Thanks for watching.
